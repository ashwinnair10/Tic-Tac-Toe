# Tic Tac Toe - Basic Version

This project is a very basic version of Tic Tac Toe coded in C++ to be run on the terminal. It features a simple text-based interface and a basic menu that allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid. The game prompts players to enter their moves, checks for wins or draws, and displays the game board after each move.
